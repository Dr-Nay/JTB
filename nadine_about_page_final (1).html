        <p><strong>Hello, I'm Dr. Nadine Elestina McClain</strong></p>
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the digital world. I'm a transformational author, pastor, and CEO committed to helping you unlock the next chapter of your life with purpose and power. Whether you're navigating change, seeking clarity, or ready for change, I'm here to walk that journey with you.</p>
        <p><em>Bahamas-based | Pastor & Author | Biblical Foundation for Personal Transformation</em></p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p><strong>"Success taught me everything except how to truly live…"</strong></p>
        <p>I wrote this book while healing from grief, completing my doctorate, living during the COVID-19 pandemic, and walking out my faith with fresh fire.</p>
        <p>This journey through loss, growth, spiritual awakening, and pastoral calling led me to write <em>The Journey to Becoming: Keys to Personal Growth and Transformation</em> — a biblically-grounded guidebook born from years of real-world experience.</p>
        <p>This isn't just theory on pages, it's a roadmap forged through my own journey of becoming.</p>
        <p>Today, I help others begin their own transformational journey through my writing, pastoral ministry, speaking, and meaningful conversations rooted in biblical truth.</p>
        <p>This isn't just my story, it's an invitation to write your next chapter.</p>

        <h2>About <em>The Journey to Becoming</em></h2>
